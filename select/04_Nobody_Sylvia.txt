Sittin' in restaurant she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said who is that
You said with a smile
Oh it's nobody, oh nobody

Well maybe that explains the last two weeks
You called me up, dead on your feet
Working late again
I ask who with, you said nobody, oh nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive you were miles away
I ask who's on your mind, you said nobody
Why do you ask
Oh her again, I could've told you that

We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself, I've got one shot left
You're still mine and I won't stand in line behind nobody, nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name, well I wonder
Does she think she's being clever
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better
Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name, well I wonder
Does she think she's being clever
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Oh well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name, well I wonder
Does she think she's being clever
