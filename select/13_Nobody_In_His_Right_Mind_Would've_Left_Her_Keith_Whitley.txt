I burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
To that old flame that burns inside of me
She cried when I left her now I cry to forget her
Oh how foolish I was to ever want to leave

Nobody in his right mind would've left her
I had to be crazy to say goodbye
Nobody in his right mind would've left her
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

I still carry her picture I wish her well
With the new love I know she's found by now
Each night finds me dreaming each day I spend thinking
How much I wish she was still around

Cause nobody in his right mind would've left her...
Even my heart was smart enough to stay behind
